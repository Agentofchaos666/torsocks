.SH NAME
torsocks \(em Shell wrapper to simplify the use of the torsocks(8) library to
transparently torify an application.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
torsocks [OPTIONS] [COMMAND [ARG ...]]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBtorsocks\fP is a wrapper between the torsocks library and the application in
order to make every Internet communication go through the Tor network.

By default, torsocks will assume that it should connect to the Tor SOCKS proxy
running at 127.0.0.1 on port 9050 being the defaults of the Tor daemon.

In order to use a configuration file, torsocks tries to read the
\fB@CONFDIR@/tor/torsocks.conf\fP file or look for the environment variable
TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE with the location of the file. If that file cannot be read,
torsocks will use sensible defaults for most Tor installations.

For further information on configuration, see
.BR torsocks.conf(5).
