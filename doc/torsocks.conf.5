.SH NAME
torsocks.conf \(em Configuration file for torsocks(8)

.SH SUMMARY

By default, torsocks will assume that it should connect to the Tor SOCKS proxy
running at 127.0.0.1 on port 9050. This is the default address and port for
Tor's socks server on most installations. If you are running a normal Tor
installation and have no special requirements, then you should not need to
create, edit or invoke a configuration file when using torsocks.

Your installation of torsocks includes a default configuration file
that contains values sensible for use with most Tor installations. The
installation location for your default configuration file is:

/etc/tor/torsocks.conf

In order to use a configuration file, you must set the environment variable
TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE with the location of the file.

If TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE is not set, torsocks will attempt to read the
configuration file at /etc/tor/torsocks.conf. If that file cannot be read,
torsocks will use sensible defaults for most Tor installations, i.e. it will
assume that you want to use a SOCKS proxy running at 127.0.0.1 (localhost) on
port 9050.

.SH CONFIGURATION

.SS SYNTAX
The basic structure of all lines in the configuration file is:

.RS
<directive> <parameters>
.RE

Empty lines are ignored and all input on a line after a '#' character is
ignored.

.SS DIRECTIVES
The following directives are used in the torsocks configuration file:

.TP
.I TorAddress
The IP address of the Tor SOCKS server (e.g "server = 10.1.4.253"). Only one
server may be specified. Currently, torsocks does NOT support hostname.
(default: 127.0.0.1)

.TP
.I TorPort
The port on which the Tor SOCKS server receives requests. (default: 9050)

.TP
.I OnionAddrRange
Tor hidden sites do not have real IP addresses. This specifies what range of IP
addresses will be handed to the application as "cookies" for .onion names.  Of
course, you should pick a block of addresses which you aren't going to ever
need to actually connect to. This is similar to the MapAddress feature of the
main tor daemon. (default: 127.42.42.0/24)

.SH EXAMPLE
  $ export TORSOCKS_CONF_FILE=$PWD/torsocks.conf
