# Wrapper script for use of the torsocks(8) transparent socksification library
#
# There are three forms of usage for this script:
#
# @prefix@/bin/torsocks program [program arguments...]
#
# This form sets the users LD_PRELOAD environment variable so that torsocks(8)
# will be loaded to socksify the application then executes the specified 
# program (with the provided arguments). The following simple example might 
# be used to telnet to www.foo.org via a torsocks.conf(5) configured socks server:
#
# @prefix@/bin/torsocks telnet www.foo.org
#
# The second form allows for torsocks(8) to be switched on and off for a
# session (that is, it adds and removes torsocks from the LD_PRELOAD environment
# variable). This form must be _sourced_ into the user's existing session
# (and will only work with bourne shell users):
#
# . @prefix@/bin/torsocks on
# telnet www.foo.org 
# . @prefix@/bin/torsocks off
# 
# Or
# 
# source @prefix@/bin/torsocks on
# telnet www.foo.org
# source @prefix@/bin/torsocks off
#
# The third form creates a new shell with LD_PRELOAD set and is achieved
# simply by running the script with no arguments 
# 
# @prefix@/bin/torsocks
#
# When finished the user can simply terminate the shell with 'exit'
# 
# This script is originally from the debian torsocks package by
# Tamas Szerb <toma@rulez.org>
# Modified by Robert Hogan <robert@roberthogan.net> April 16th 2006
