.SH DESCRIPTION
.B torsocks
is a wrapper between the torsocks library and the application what you
would like to run socksified.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB[application\ \fB[application's\ arguments]]
run the application as specified with the environment (LD_PRELOAD) set
such that torsocks(8) will transparently proxy SOCKS connections in
that program
.IP \fB[on|off]
this option adds or removes torsocks(8) from the LD_PRELOAD environment
variable. When torsocks(8) is in this variable all executed
applications are automatically socksified. If you want to
use this function, you HAVE to source the shell script from yours,
like this: "source /usr/bin/torsocks" or ". /usr/bin/torsocks"
.br
Example:
.br
". torsocks on" -- add the torsocks lib to LD_PRELOAD
.br
". torsocks off" -- remove the torsocks lib from LD_PRELOAD
.IP \fB[show|sh]
show the current value of the LD_PRELOAD variable
.IP \fB<without\ any\ argument>
create a new shell with LD_PRELOAD including torsocks(8).
