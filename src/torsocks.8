.SH NAME
.BR torksocks 
\- Library for intercepting outgoing network connections and
redirecting them through a SOCKS server. 

.SH SYNOPSIS

Set LD_PRELOAD to load the library then use applications as normal

The syntax to force preload of the library for different shells is
specified below:
 
Bash, Ksh and Bourne shell -

export LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libtorksocks.so

C Shell - 

setenv LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libtorksocks.so

This process can be automated (for Bash, Bourne and Korn shell 
users) for a single command or for all commands in a shell session
by using the torksocks(1) script

You can also setup torksocks in such a way that all processes 
automatically use it, a very useful configuration. For more 
information on this configuration see the CAVEATS section of this
manual page.

.SH DESCRIPTION

.BR torksocks
is a library to allow transparent SOCKS proxying. It wraps the normal
connect() function. When a connection is attempted, it consults the 
configuration file (which is defined at configure time but defaults to 
/etc/torksocks.conf) and determines if the IP address specified is local. If 
it is not, the library redirects the connection to a SOCKS server
specified in the configuration file. It then negotiates that connection
with the SOCKS server and passes the connection back to the calling
program. 

.BR torksocks 
is designed for use in machines which are firewalled from then
internet. It avoids the need to recompile applications like lynx or
telnet so they can use SOCKS to reach the internet. It behaves much like
the SOCKSified TCP/IP stacks seen on other platforms.

.SS ARGUMENTS
Most arguments to
.BR torksocks
are provided in the configuration file (the location of which is defined
at configure time by the \-\-with\-conf=<file> argument but defaults to
/etc/torksocks.conf). The structure of this file is documented in torksocks.conf(8)

Some configuration options can be specified at run time using environment
variables as follows: 

.TP
.I TORKSOCKS_CONFFILE
This environment variable overrides the default location of the torksocks 
configuration file. This variable is not honored if the program torksocks
is embedded in is setuid. In addition this environment variable can
be compiled out of torksocks with the \-\-disable\-envconf argument to 
configure at build time

.TP
.I TORKSOCKS_DEBUG
This environment variable sets the level of debug output that should be
generated by torksocks (debug output is generated in the form of output to 
standard error). If this variable is not present by default the logging 
level is set to 0 which indicates that only error messages should be output. 
Setting it to higher values will cause torksocks to generate more messages 
describing what it is doing. If set to \-1 torksocks will output absolutely no 
error or debugging messages. This is only needed if torksocks output interferes 
with a program it is embedded in. Message output can be permanently compiled 
out of torksocks by specifying the \-\-disable\-debug option to configure at 
build time

.TP
.I TORKSOCKS_DEBUG_FILE
This option can be used to redirect the torksocks output (which would normally 
be sent to standard error) to a file. This variable is not honored if the 
program torksocks is embedded in is setuid. For programs where torksocks output 
interferes with normal operation this option is generally better than 
disabling messages (with TORKSOCKS_DEBUG = \-1)

.TP
.I TORKSOCKS_USERNAME
This environment variable can be used to specify the username to be used when
version 5 SOCKS servers request username/password authentication. This 
overrides the default username that can be specified in the configuration
file using 'default_user', see torksocks.conf(8) for more information. This 
variable is ignored for version 4 SOCKS servers.

.TP
.I TORKSOCKS_PASSWORD
This environment variable can be used to specify the password to be used when 
version 5 SOCKS servers request username/password authentication. This 
overrides the default password that can be specified in the configuration 
file using 'default_pass', see torksocks.conf(8) for more information. This 
variable is ignored for version 4 SOCKS servers.
 
.SS DNS ISSUES
.BR torksocks
will normally not be able to send DNS queries through a SOCKS server since
SOCKS V4 works on TCP and DNS normally uses UDP. Version 1.5 and up do
however provide a method to force DNS lookups to use TCP, which then makes
them proxyable. This option can only enabled at compile time, please
consult the INSTALL file for more information.

.SS ERRORS
.BR torksocks
will generate error messages and print them to stderr when there are
problems with the configuration file or the SOCKS negotiation with the
server if the TORKSOCKS_DEBUG environment variable is not set to \-1 or and
\-\-disable\-debug was not specified at compile time. This output may cause
some problems with programs that redirect standard error.

.SS CAVEATS
.BR torksocks
will not in the above configuration be able to provide SOCKS proxying to
setuid applications or applications that are not run from a shell. You can
force all applications to LD_PRELOAD the library by placing the path to
libtorksocks in /etc/ld.so.preload. Please make sure you correctly enter the
full path to the library in this file if you do this. If you get it wrong,
you will be UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING with the machine and will have to boot
it with a rescue disk and remove the file (or try the saveme program, see
the INSTALL file for more info).  THIS IS A ***WARNING***, please be
careful. Also be sure the library is in the root filesystem as all hell
will break loose if the directory it is in is not available at boot time.

.SH BUGS

.BR torksocks
can only proxy outgoing TCP connections

.BR torksocks
does NOT work correctly with asynchronous sockets (though it does work with
non blocking sockets). This bug would be very difficult to fix and there 
appears to be no demand for it (I know of no major application that uses
asynchronous sockets)

.BR torksocks
is NOT fully RFC compliant in its implementation of version 5 of SOCKS, it
only supports the 'username and password' or 'no authentication'
authentication methods. The RFC specifies GSSAPI must be supported by any
compliant implementation. I haven't done this, anyone want to help?

.BR torksocks
can force the libc resolver to use TCP for name queries, if it does this
it does it regardless of whether or not the DNS to be queried is local or
not. This introduces overhead and should only be used when needed.

.BR torksocks 
uses ELF dynamic loader features to intercept dynamic function calls from
programs in which it is embedded.  As a result, it cannot trace the 
actions of statically linked executables, non-ELF executables, or 
executables that make system calls directly with the system call trap or 
through the syscall() routine.
